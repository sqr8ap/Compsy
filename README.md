# PSYC 4215

This repo contains my assignments for PSYC 4215: Computational Methods in Psychology & Neuroscience. 

See "A09_Final_Project_seed-based_fMRI_analysis_sqr8ap.ipynb" for my final project, in which I utilized Nilearn in Python to analyze statistical maps derived from fMRI images to test hypotheses regarding differences in functional connectivity across different brain regions and task states. I found significant differences in functional connectivity across various cortical regions at rest and during the experimental task state. Visualizations in this document depict the aforementioned differences in functional connectivity.
